# Autonomous-RC-Car
The goal of this project is to make a self driving autonomous RC car. 

## Why
We came across a competition called RoboRacer where different teams build an autonomous RC car and compete against each other to
see who has the fastest, which got us very interested in doing something similar. One thing that we noticed initially was the fact
that these cars would be expensive as most teams are sponsored by various tech companies. Being a bunch of college students, we would 
not be able to afford building one on our own as these cars can get as costly as upwards of $5-6k. Fortunately, we were able to find a 
professor here at Texas A&M who agreed to give us a funding of $2.5k to build a cheaper version of this RC car.

## Components of the Car
This car is equippped with a NVIDIA Jetson Nano Orin, a 360Â° LiDAR,
