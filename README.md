# Autonomous-RC-Car
The goal of this project is to make a self driving autonomous RC car. 

## Why
We came across a competition called RoboRacer where different teams build an autonomous RC car and compete against each other to
see who has the fastest, which got us very interested in doing something similar. One thing that we noticed initially was the fact
that these cars would be expensive as most teams are sponsored by various tech companies. Being a bunch of college students, we would 
not be able to afford building one on our own as these cars can get as costly as upwards of $5-6k. Fortunately, we were able to find a 
professor here at Texas A&M who agreed to give us a funding of $2.5k to build a cheaper version of this RC car.

## Components of the Car
We used a 1/10th Traxxas ST Rally VXL Brushless car for our base kit. The body was taken off and a top plate was laser cut in order 
to house a NVIDIA Jetson Nano Orin, a 360Â° LiDAR, a VESC, a powerboard, and various other electrical peripherals. The top plate was
made from a 1/8" acrylic plate, was designed in SolidWorks, and laser cut through the MEEN Rapid Prototyping Studio at Texas A&M. Most
of the hardware was fastened using M3 screws and standoffs. A holder was printed for the NVIDIA Jetson Nano since it did not have any
mounting holes. Furthermore, a holder was 3d printed in order to mount the antenna onto the top plate of the car.

## Tuning the Car
Since the Car we bought was prebuilt, we had to manually mesh the gears as they would make a skipping noise while running. I used a thin
strip of paper and placed it between the spur and pinion in order to properly mesh both the gears. Next, we had to tune the vesc which was
very crucial in order to
